## ✨ Features

* 🖼️ **Infinite Image Grid** with seamless x/y scrolling
* 🖱️ **Click-and-Drag Navigation** with touch support
* 🧲 **GSAP Animations** for image and caption reveal
* 🪟 **Popup Modal** for fullscreen preview with caption
* 🧩 **Smart Tiling** using repeated DOM elements with offset tracking

* 🖋️ **SplitText Animation** for staggered caption entry
* 📱 **Responsive Behavior** with scalable tile layout

## 🧠 How It Works

* **Grid Items** are duplicated in both X and Y directions to give the illusion of infinite space.
* **GSAP's `SplitText`** plugin animates captions on intersection with the viewport.
* **Mouse and Touch Input** controls the scroll target, using smoothed interpolation for motion.
* **Popup Viewer** uses GSAP animations on entry/exit with a caption passed via state.
* **Images reposition** based on scroll and wrap around when out of bounds to create the infinite loop.
* **Tile Scaling** adjusts to screen ratio using a fixed original grid size.
